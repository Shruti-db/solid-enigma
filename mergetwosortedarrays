There are theree methods for this:
1. create a new array of size n1+n2, add the elements to this, sort it, then push the element back to both the arrays. Time Complexity
   o(nlogn)+ o(n) + o(n), space complexity O(n)
2. Take advantage of the fact that the initial array is sorted, compare the element. if it;s greate then swap and again sort the second array, Time complexity 
  O(n*m);
3. gap Method, Time Complexity O(nlogn)
   take gap = size/2;
   place the two indices gap distance apart, compare and swap, then proceed
   successively reduce the gap to 1, the final ararys will now be sorted.
